# TP Feedback for Team 12
                                        
**TP Grade**: A
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design but does not work well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly analysed to form conclusions leading to future work, but quality of analysis may be lacking
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
demonstrated decent software development processes across some aspects of creating/delegating/monitoring work packets across members collaboratively
                                        
## Other feedback
Good expression of immersion design and clear articulation of how implementation relates to goals. However the actual implementation does fall short of what the intended immersion goals are.

Good application of data collection methods for a single immersion construct.
However, the analysis falls short in terms of detail and clarity, e.g., did not attempt to explain scores using their implementation and thereby what specific aspects to improve specific to their app.

Documentation - clear and nicely structured.
Software engineering - decent tasks distribution and tracking shown using github issues. Suggest use of explicit acceptance criteria will be better.
